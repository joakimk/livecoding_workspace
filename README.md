# Livecoding workspace

A javascript live coding workspace written using Elixir and Phoenix. You can do this with pure js tools, but I like Elixir better :)

# TODO

- add websocket reload
- add animation and ensure it does not break or jump strangely when you edit the code
- find out how to write module code better
- gif video
- add file structure docs to usage
- add export instructions

# Installing

    mix deps.get
    npm install

# Usage

Start the server

    mix phoenix.server

Visit http://localhost:4000

Then edit [web/static/js/cube.coffee](web/static/js/cube.coffee) and see the changes appear in the browser right away.

Now go and play around with the code :)

# Exporting the final result to a HTML file

TODO: instructions
